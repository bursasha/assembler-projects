Computer Structures and Architectures was an obligatory course 
registered by students of the program Informatics during the second semester. 👨🏽‍💻

The course aim was to acquaint students with the function and inner parts of the
digital computer together with the fundamentals of its construction. 🖥 

Lectures deal with the following topics: methods of digital circuit design, 
representating data inside the computer, performing arithmetic operations, 
types of instruction set architectures, processor inner structure and memory
systems. Labs are oriented above all on performing practical tasks. 🔧

The professional design system Xilinx Vivado was used as a working tool 
for the design of digital circuits which are then implemented on the base 
of XILINX gate arrays. 🔌

Low level programs were written in assembler, developed and debugged by 
means of the AVR studio and then run on the processor Atmega 169. 💻
